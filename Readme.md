We are aiming to look at the datasets that the MonarchKG pulls in to find a subset of NCBITaxon's which have overlap. The aim of this process is to avoid "dangling" information from any one source. We also want to ensure we very strongly preserve well curated information - such as fly phenotypes - and also provide coverage for human genes which lack more robust annotations from other services.
